# Interactive SVG Examples

This project contains interactive examples of various shapes provided in the SVG language.

These examples are typically self-contained HTML files with embedded JavaScript.

Raphael.js is used to simplify the dynamic creation of SVG. Raphael.js is licensed under the MIT license, which is replicated below as requested by the license.

Sylvester.js is used to perform the matrix and vector calculations required to figure out the centre of the ellipse in the arc path demo.

If you wish to contribute a new example, fork the repo, copy whichever example seems closest to what you want to do, edit and send me a pull request.

Current examples:
